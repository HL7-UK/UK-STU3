###  Introduction

This is a demonstration Implementation Guide for HL7 UK Base. However the intent is to make it useable for Validation and as a base for other implementation guides.
The profiles have been altered to fix a number of minor faults and so are not official (use them at your own risk).
 

### Overview

The IG is open source. The GitHub repository can be found here: [GitHub Project Wildfyre](https://project-wildfyre.github.io/UK-STU3/)
