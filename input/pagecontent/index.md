### Introduction
This implementation guide is provided to support the use of FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in a United Kingdom context.

This document is a working specification that is expected to be implemented and tested by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers
to enable feedback to improve the content of this guide.

### Scope

This document presents UK use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts; these are collaborative outputs with agreed approaches to varied kinds of healthcare related information based on the core FHIR STU3 specification. 
* [Profiles](profiles.html) - are useful constraints of core FHIR resources and datatype for UK use
* [Extensions](extensions.html) - are FHIR extensions that are added for local use, covering needed UK concepts
* **Terminologies** - are defined or referenced in [code systems](codesystems.html), [value sets](valuesets.html) and [concept maps](conceptmaps.html) for UK context

### Usage

This document is a working specification that may be directly implemented by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers.

Information contained in this document is aimed at providing guidance on representing UK local concepts 
using FHIR. This includes code systems, extensions and profiles on base FHIR types.  The content of the IG is 
general in nature and seeks to provide a ‘how-to’ guide when representing concepts, it includes core base
profiles that can be further constrained for a particular usage.

### Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:

* [INTEROPen](https://www.interopen.org/)
